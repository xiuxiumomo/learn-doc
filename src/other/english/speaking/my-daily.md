I ordered a cup of coffee 30 mins ago.

It's raining,so the develiry is late.

I met the develiry person when I went to the M floor to pick up my order.





It's  Friday today.

My wife wants to eat spicy food.

We decided to cook hot pot.


Last sunday I ordered two cups juice,but I entered wrong address,so they were develived to my company.
