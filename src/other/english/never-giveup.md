”Years from now, some of them may look back and ask whether they made right choices, whether they’ve made the most opportunities they’ve been given. Together we have the same mission. Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair, you will find things that happened to you are not always warranted.



You have to put your heads down and fight, fight, fight, Never ever ever give up. Don’t give in , don’t back down and never stop doing that you know is right. Nothing worth doing never ever ever came easy. The more righteous you are fighting , the more opposition you will face. 


You have to go into the world and turn your hopes and the dreams into actions.



America is always the land of dreams, because America is the nation of the true believers. When the pilgrims  landed at Plymouth they pray.When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence they invoked our creator four times.  Because in  America we don’t worship the government, we worship God! 



It is why our currency proudly declares” In God we trust” and why we proudly proclaim that we are on nation under God. The story of America, the story of adventure that began with deep faith, big dreams and humble beginnings. 



The next generation of leaders never ever give up. There will be times in your life you want to quit, never quit fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you. Carry yourself with dignity and pride. Demand the best from yourself.


The more people tell you is not possible that can’t be done, the more you should absolutely determined to prove them wrong. Treat the world ”impossible” as nothing more than motivation. 



Relish the opportunity to be outsider, the more that a broken system tells you that you are wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead, you must keep pushing forward.


 
Always have the courage to beat yourself. America is better when people put their faith in their actions.
 

 
Pray to God and follow his teachings! Today each of you begins a new chapter as well. When your story goes from here, if will be defined by your vision, your perseverance and your grit.
 

 
We  will build a future will we have courage to chase our dreams, no matter what cynics and doubters have to say. 
   

 
You will have confidence to speak the hopes in your hearts and express the love that stirs your soul as long as you have pride in your beliefs.
 

  
Courage your convictions and faith in God, then you will not fail. As long as America remain true to its values. Loyal to its citizens and devote to its creator, then our best days are yet to come.
