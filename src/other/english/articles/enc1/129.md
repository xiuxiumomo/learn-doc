## Seventy miles an hour  

- Look, Gar
- That policeman's waving to you.
- He wants you to stop.
- Where do you think you are?
- On a race track? /reɪs/
- You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.
- I can't have been.
- I was doing eighty when I overtook you.
- Didn't you see the speed limit?
- I'm afraid I didn't, officer.
- I must have been dreaming.
- He wasn't dreaming, officer.
- I was telling him to drive slowly.
- That's why I didn't see the sign.
- Let me see your driving licence.
- I won't charge you this time.
- But you'd better not do it again!
- Thank you.
- I'll certainly be more careful.
- I told you to drive slowly, Gary.
- You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.
- Well, next time you'd better take my advice!
