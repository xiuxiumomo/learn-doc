## Tea for two
- Can't you come in and have tea now, Peter?
- Not yet.
- I must water the garden first.
- Do you have to water it now
- I'm afraid I must.
- Look at it!
- It's terribly dry.
- What a nuisance! /ˈnuːs(ə)ns/ /麻烦事/
- Last summer it was very dry, too.
- Don't you remember?
- I had to water it every day.
- Well, I'll have tea by myself.
- That was quick!
- Have you finished already?
- Yes.
- Look out of the window.
- It's raining!
- That means you don't need to water the garden.
- That was a pleasant surprise.
- It means I can have tea, instead.
