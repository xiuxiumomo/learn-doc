## Don't be so sure!

- What's the problem about deciding on a holiday?
- Where are you going to spend your holidays this year, Gary?
- We may go abroad.
- I'm not sure.
- My wife wants to go to Egypt. /ˈiːdʒɪpt/
- I'd like to go there, too.
- We can't make up our minds.
- Will you travel by sea or by air?
- We may travel by sea.
- It's cheaper, isn't it?
- It may be cheaper, but it takes a long time.
- I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves.
- Don't be so sure.
- We might not go anywhere.
- My wife always worries too much.
- Who's going to look after the dog?
- Who's going to look after the house?
- Who's going to look after the garden?
- We have this problem every year.
- In the end, we stay at home and look after everything!
