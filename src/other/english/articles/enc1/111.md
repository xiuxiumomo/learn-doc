## The most expensive model

- I like this television very much.
- How much does it cost?
- It's the most expensive model in the shop.
- It costs five hundred pounds.
- That's too expensive for us.
- We can't afford all that money.
- This model's less expensive than that one.
- It's only three hundred pounds.
- But, of course, it's not as good as the expensive one.
- I don't like this model.
- The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.
- Can we buy it on instalments?
- Of course.
- You can pay a deposit `/dɪˈpɑːzɪt/` of thirty pounds,
- and then fourteen pounds a month for three years.
- Do you like it, dear?
- I certainly do, but I don't like the price.
- You always want the best, but we can't afford it.
- Sometimes you think you're a millionaire!
- Millionaires don't buy things on instalments!
