## A pleasant dream 

> 惬意的

- Are you doing the football pools,`/puːlz/` Brain?

- Yes, I've `/aɪv/` nearly finished, Julie.

- I'm sure we'll win something this week.

- You always say that, but we never win anything!

- What will you do if you win a lot of money?

- If I win a lot of money I'll buy you a mink coat.

- I don't want a mink coat!

- I want to see the world.

- All right.

- If we win a lot of money we'll travel round the world `/wɜːrld/` and we'll stay at the best hotels.

- Then we'll return home and buy a big house in the country.

- We'll have a beautiful garden and...

- But if we spend all that money we'll be poor again.

- What'll `/wɒtl/` we do then?

- If we spend all the money we'll try and win the football pools again.

- It's a pleasant dream but everything depends on 'if' !
