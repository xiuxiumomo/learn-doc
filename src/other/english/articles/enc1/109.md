## A good idea

- What does Jane have with her coffee?
- Shall I make some coffee, Jane?
- That's a good idea, Charlotte.
- It's ready.
- Do you want any milk?
- Just a little, please.
- What about some sugar?
- Two teaspoonfuls?
- No, less than that.
- One and a half teaspoonfuls, please.
- That's enough for me.
- That was very nice.
- Would you like some more?
- Yes, please.
- I'd like a cigarette, too.
- May I have one?
- Of course.
- I think there are a few in that box.
- I'm afraid it's empty.
- What a pity!
- It doesn't matter.
- Have a biscuit instead.
- Eat more and smoke less!
- That's very good advice!
