## A trip to Australia
- Look, Scott.
- This is a photograph  `/ˈfoʊtəɡræf/` I took during my trip to Australia.
- Let me see it, Mike.
- This is a good photograph.
- Who are these people?
- They're people I met during the trip.
- That's the ship `/ʃɪp/` we travelled on.
- What a beautiful ship!
- Who's this?
- That's the man I told you about.
- Remember?
- Ah yes.
- The one who offered you a job in Australia.
- That's right.
- Who's this?
- Guess!
- It's not you, is it?
- That's right.
- I grew a beard `/bɪrd/` during the trip, but I shaved it off when I came home.                       
- Why did you shave it off?
- My wife didn't like it!
