## Knock, knock!
- Isn't there anyone at home?
- I'll knock again, Helen.
- Everything's very quiet.
- I'm sure there's no one at home.
- But that's impossible.
- Carol and Tom invited us to lunch.
- Look through the window.
- Can you see anything?
- Nothing at all.
- Let's try the back door.
- Look! Everyone's in the garden.
- Hello, Helen. Hello, Jim.
- Everybody wants to have lunch in the garden.
- It's nice and warm out here.
- Come and have something to drink.
- Thanks, Carol.
- May I have a glass of beer please?
- Beer?
- There's none left.
- You can have some lemonade.
- Lemonade!
- Don't believe her, Jim.
- She's only joking.
- Have some beer!
