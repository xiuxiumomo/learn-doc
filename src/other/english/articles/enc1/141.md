- 3.Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before.

- 4.She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw.

- 5.Suddenly, a middle-age lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally.

- 6.'Hello, little girl,' she said.

- 7.Sally did not answer, but looked at her curiously.

- 8.The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat.

- 9.After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact.

- 10.She then began to make up her face.

- 11.'Why are you doing that?' Sally asked.

- 12.'To make myself beautiful,' the lady answered.

- 13.She put away her compact and smiled kindly.

- 14.'But you are still ugly,' Sally said.

- 15.Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed! /ɪmˈbærəst/
