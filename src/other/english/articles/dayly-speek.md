## How to improve my English





### Methods 1: No-Chinese Zone Thinking
Pick simple daily moments and think only in English.
Walking:

“I’m walking to the office.”

Drinking water:

“I’m thirsty.”

Sitting down:

“I’m tired.”



If you don’t know a word → use easier English, NOT Chinese.

### Methods 2.Replace translation with pictures 

Yoyr brain understands images faster than language:

Training: 

See rain →
❌ 下雨了 → It’s raining
✅ ☔ → “It’s raining.”

See your wife →
❌ 我老婆怀孕了 → My wife is pregnant
✅ 🤰 → “My wife is pregnant.”

Do this silently in your head.


### Methods 3 Memorize full sentences,not words.

❌ older = 更大
✅ She is four years older than me.

Say full sentences every day.

### Methods 4. Timed speaking (powerful)

set a timer for 60 seconds

Prompt:
>  Talk about your family.

Rules: 
- no stopping
- no chinese 
- no correction

your brain has no time to translate,so it switches modes. 
Do this once pre day.

### Methods 5 Shadowing (brain re-wiring)

Listen to 1-2 minutes of native audio and copy immediately.

You are not learing words

Your are learning how English thinks.
