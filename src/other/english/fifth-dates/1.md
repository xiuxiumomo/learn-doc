- ...to have and to hold from this day forh...
- ...as long as you both shall live?
- I do. - Really?
- Even though in, like, 10, 15 years...
- ...she could possibly let herself go and then, like...
- ...sex could be, like, nauseating for you?
- What are you, nuts? Your wife's right over there.
- I'm just kidding, Muumuu!
- I now pronounce you man and wife.
- Mazel tov!
- It's very cold, so when you're ready...
- ...put on a jacket and come have breakfast with me. Love you.
- Hey, hey! Good morning, Mrs. Roth. Would you like to meet your daughter?
- Go say hello to Mommy. 
- Hi, Mommy.
- That's right.
- Good morning.
- Oh, my goodness!
- Grandpa's here. - Hi, Dad.
