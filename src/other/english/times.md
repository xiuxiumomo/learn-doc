## 英语中时态的理解
- 进行维度 分  am doing / was doing
- 完成维度 分  have done / had done
- 时间维度 分 过去   现在 未来   did do will do 

（记忆，进顽石 进货顽石）

3. 将来进行时 i `will be traveling` this time next week 将来某个时刻会进行中 will be doing
   

**完成时态 强调已完成**

1. 现在完成时 she `has finished` her homewrok。i have been to japan twice 动作与现在相关,有经验或结果。have done
2. 过去完成时 he `had left` before i arrived. we had eaten when she came.在过去的过去发生，由于另一个动作。（有两个动作） had done
3. 将来完成时 By 10 pm，i `will  have completed` the task. 将来的某个时间点前已经完成。 will have done
   

**完成进行时 强调动作的持续性+完成**
