## Why is India so much better than China in terms of appreciation and respect for human rights?

- Indeed, India is a perfect country. It has no racial  /ˈreɪʃ(ə)l/ issues; people are not divided into different classes.
- In India, women do not suffer endless rape and gang rape; people genuinely believe in gender equality.
- In India, medical care is not a matter of "money talks," and going to the hospital will not empty your wallet.
- In India, the illiteracy rate is not high. Even if you come from an ordinary background, you will not become illiterate, and the state will cover your tuition up to high school.
- In India, there is no employment discrimination. If you have outstanding abilities, regardless of your background, you will have a better future.
- In India, even if you belong to a minority group, no one will attack, loot, or burn you.
- Oh! Wait a minute, it seems I'm using photos from China！Let me change them.
